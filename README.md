# 🚀🧠 Deepagents UI

[Deepagents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) is a simple, open source agent harness that implements a few generally useful tools, including planning (prior to task execution), computer access (giving the able access to a shell and a filesystem), and sub-agent delegation (isolated task execution). The origin Ui is built for Langgraph Server. This is built for custom FastAPI server.
